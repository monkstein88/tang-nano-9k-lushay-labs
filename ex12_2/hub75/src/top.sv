//  < Tang Nano 9K: HUB75 LED Panels (64 (columns) x 64 (rows) pixels)>
//
// In this article, we will dive into LED pixel matrix panels and create some drivers to interface with this type of screen. The type of panel we are going to be using is sometimes called a HUB75 panel based on the interface and comes in a 
// variety of sizes and densities.
// This article was developed by Chandler Kl√ºser and follows his exploration of this protocol.
//
// 
// < What is HUB75 ?
//
// It sounds like a simple question, and based on the popularity of these boards you would think it would be easy to find the source. However, it seems HUB75 is a protocol that has emerged from the LED panel industry without being formally 
// standardized by any specific party.
// These LED matrix panels essentially work by having a row of pixels shifted into a shift register and then a demultiplexer to select which of the rows the data should be displayed on. By altering through the rows quickly you can draw an entire 
// image to the panel.
// So essentially you select a row using the address bits, then shift in a pixel value for each pixel in the row. With the row data pushed in, you latch the data to store and output the value of the shift register to the LED of that row; repeating
// the cycle per row.
// Each pixel is an RGB pixel, meaning for each pixel you output 3 bits one for if the red LED in the pixel should be lit, one for green, and one for blue. In this article, we will be using a 64x64 LED panel, so we need to shift in 64 RGB values
// for each line.

// With 3 bits of color data per pixel, you essentially have 8 possible color options per update just like the ZX Spectrum. The HUB75 connector to interface this type of screen has the following pinout:

// Instead of going through 32 lines, you have 2 channels of pixels RGB1 and RGB2 making each update draw two lines at a time, giving you only 32 lines to address. The addressing is done using the A, B, C, and D inputs. The way the 2 channels of 
// pixels work, is that the top half of the board is controlled by RGB1 and the bottom half of the board is updated by RGB2 so when you update the first line you also update line 17, and then line 2 and line 18, etc.

// Other than that we have a CLK signal which is used to shift data into the shift register chain and a LATCH signal to move the shifted-in data to the output (pixels). This allows you to first shift out the entire row before updating the screen
// (which would cause flickering / scrolling).
// Finally OE or Output Enable is used as the global output switch to turn on and off all the pixels of the screen. This can also be modulated to control the brightness intensity of the output. These screens, given enough current, can be quite 
// bright so by limiting the amount of time the output is enabled (OE is usually active low) you can dial in the brightness and current consumption.
// Another feature of these boards is their ability to be daisy-chained extending the pixel count to any arbitrary size.
//                                       
// ...
// 
// So for 2 boards, you would just shift in 128 pixel values instead of 64 and everything else would stay the same making it easier to scale up.
// With that theory out of the way, we can start with electrically connecting the Tang Nano to this panel.

// Luckily not too much is needed, the logic interface can be run directly via 3.3V so only some sort of connector is needed to be wired up and no other passive components are required.
// In this example, we will be wiring it up like so, but any pins (in the 3.3v banks) could work for this:
//
// ...
//
// Standard header pins can be used to create a 2x8 connector for the panel's cable again the pinout for the connector should be the following:

// The only important thing to remember is the direction of the header, these ribbon cables usually have a key or outdent which allows it to slot in, in the correct direction. This can be seen in the image above next to the BLUE1 and A pins there 
// is a slot. When creating a connector using standard male headers, you won't have a special key and you need to keep track of this manually.
// Once wired up you should have something like the following:
//
// ...
//
// This will allow you to connect up the LED panel to the TangNano directly like so:
//
// ...
//
// Other than that, the LED panel also requires hooking up the power signal to its external power pins. The voltage range is usually pretty flexible and can run even at 3.3v but ideally should be run at around 4-5v. The panel can consume a lot 
// of power if all the LEDs are lit (I was reaching 1-2 amps with PWM) so a sufficient power supply should be used.
// At lower voltages (3.3v) I also noticed more flickering artifacts on unlit (black) pixels, but other than that the voltage mostly affects the brightness of the colors.
// For the Tang Nano 9K itself, we will be powering it with the USB cable so nothing special there to setup. With the electronics done, we can now start implementing our first LED Matrix driver.

// So before we get into anything fancy, let's try lighting up a single pixel on a single line.
// Let's start by creating a module:
//
//
// < Displaying an Image >
//
// To display a full image on the screen we simply need to do the same process as updating a single line, just 32 times. We also want to dynamically set the RGB value of each pixel based on our image.
// The easiest way to do this is with a frame buffer. By storing the entire image in memory, we can look up any RGB value we need, for both the top half of the screen and the bottom half, based on our pixel counter and address lines, controlling 
// the RGB output.
// We have 64x32 pixels and for each pixel, we have 3 bits of data giving us a total minimum framebuffer size of 768 bytes.
//
//   64 [columns] x 64 [rows] x 3 [rgb] = 12288 bits = 1536 Bytes  -- 2 rows   
//   64 [columns] x 32 [rows] x 3 [rgb] = 6144 bits = 768 bytes -- 1 rows
//   
// To make it easy to look up, instead of storing the data in bytes, we will set up a ROM with 2048 3-bit values, which is 64 pixels x 32 rows x 3 bits per pixel, which is what we need for each half of the screen.
// The choice of having two separate ROMs for each half of the screen versus a single ROM for both lines is an arbitrary decision and just makes the creation of the ROM slightly simpler instead of pairing lines, this is negligible though as we 
// could have stored 2048 6-bit values where each value stores a pixel for both the top and bottom half.
//
// To load our data we can use things like 'readmemh' or 'readmemb' like we have done in the past, but for this example, we will generate a static verilog ROM to showcase another method.
// So let's start with a script that will take in an image and convert it into the ROMs we will need to display an image.
//
//
// < Image Hub75 Driver >
//
// We will be using the same clock_divisor from the proof of concept, but this time instead of having static color values for the RGB signals we will want to dynamically load them based on the current pixel being shifted out. You may want to
// make your clock divisor a bit faster since we will be updating the entire screen instead of just a row:

// 
// Next, we can create our main module:

// In this module, we are simply dividing up the clock by a factor of 4096 giving us about 6.5Khz (27Mhz/4096), updating a line requires about 66 clock cycles (64-pixel shifts and two for latching) so we will be at around 100fps for a single 
// line.
// This division is arbitrary, the screen can be updated a lot faster than this, because there is no standard it is hard to say what speed will work for you, but you can play with this value lowering the pixel count from 12-bits to 6-bits or even
// smaller to play with the speed. The HUB75 board I received was able to even run at the full 27Mhz but that is usually not required as it would give you about 25,000 FPS for an entire screen update. Updating the screen too fast, even if it
// handles it, shortens the resolution of the screen brightness as the entire frame is smaller so less time/resolution to be on / off during a cycle.
endmodule

// To retrieve the pixel data we will create a framebuffer module to interface with the two generated ROMs:
module framebuffer(
  input   wire       clk,     // main clock
  input   wire [5:0] column,  // column index (6 bits for 64 pixels)
  input   wire [4:0] ADDR,    // ADDR input
  output  wire [2:0] RGB1,    // RGB1 output 
  output  wire [2:0] RGB2     // RGB2 output 
);

wire   [10:0] addr_rom; 
assign addr_rom = {ADDR, column};

ROMTop    rom_low(.clk(clk), .addr(addr_rom), .data(RGB1));
ROMBottom rom_high(.clk(clk), .addr(addr_rom), .data(RGB2));

endmodule
// The module receives the current column and address, where column is the pixel index in the x direction which is a value between 0-63 and the address lines is the row number which has a range of 0-31 combining these two gives us a 11-bit 
// index between 0-2047 that we can use to index each of the ROMs' values. We then output the RGB values for each line directly from the ROMs.






// Test Result:
//
// With this we can now run our module and you should see a single pixel lit up:
//
// ...
//
// If instead you only see the pixel flash and then turn it off this is ok, after testing multiple boards it seems some boards don't actually, allow you to pulse the OE pin and will only display the data on the first OE pulse requiring you to
// change address lines before displaying a line again.
// The issue is sometimes even more subtle than that, as some boards don't allow you to keep OE low all the time, but rather precisely control when in the cycle it should be on or off in regards to the other signals. For example one of the 
// screens required changing the address line to re-output light, so toggling between two row addresses each frame caused it to work.
// This is another disadvantage in the lack of standardization on these screens, but for most examples, you will be updating the entire screen in each frame anyway so it will work mostly as expected.
// With the proof of concept out of the way, we can now move on to displaying an entire image.
